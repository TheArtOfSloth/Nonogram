//i already have a function that builds the list of hints along the top and left sides
//rowKey and collumnKey
//i just need to print those out

//step one is to create a buffer of whitespace in the top left corner
//This will also tell me how tall to make the tallest column and how wide to make the widest row

//notes:
//rowKey[row number (from top)] [hint number in that row] = value of the hint
//i.e. a list of hints "1 5 3", "3" is stored in rowKey[some number][2]

biggestRow = 1, biggestColumn = 1
for(itorX < xsize)
  if (columnKey[itorX].largest + 1 > biggestColumn) biggestColumn = columnKey[itorX].largest + 1
  
for(itorY < ysize)
  if(rowKey[itorY].largest + 1 > biggestRow) biggestRow = rowKey[itorY].largest + 1
  
//now, biggestRow and biggestColumn are values, and we put a number of whitespace characters equal to those values

for (i < ysize){
  
  for (j < xsize){
    if (i < biggestColumn AND j < biggestRow) print " " //we're still in the corner
    if (i < biggestColumn AND j > biggestRow) print columnKey[j-biggestRow][i] //we're in in the column hints
    if (i > biggestColumn AND j < biggestRow) print rowKey[i-biggestColumn][j] //we're in the row hints
    if (i > biggestColumn AND j > biggestRow) print selection[j-biggestRow][i-biggestColumn] // we're in the grid playfield
